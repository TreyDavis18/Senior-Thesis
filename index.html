                            <p>Cryptocurrencies are a form of decentralized digital currency, meaning that the currency
                                is
                                not stored by any bank or company. Normal currencies are tracked and regulated by banks
                                who
                                will verify transactions to keep an eye on what is going on with the currencies that
                                they
                                regulate. Cryptocurrencies however, use a process of “trustless verification” to verify
                                transactions, meaning that there is no central agency who has the ledger of
                                transactions.
                                The “ledgers”, also referred to as blockchain, for different cryptocurrencies are kept
                                by
                                everyone who takes part in mining each particular cryptocurrency. (3Blue1Brown, 2017)

                            <p>Mining for Bitcoin is how new Bitcoins are added into circulation. It
                                involves solving equations on a blockchain that are typically
                                encrypted using SHA-256, a type of hash encryption. These equations are public records
                                of
                                transactions using Bitcoin, and solving these equations proves that

                                transactions are valid. Each block on the blockchain is a group of transaction records
                                that
                                needs to be verified through mining. When a user becomes the first person to solve a
                                transaction block (mine a block) they are awarded with a certain amount of bitcoin.</p>

                                One
                                very possible option for Bitcoin is to follow in the path of another highly popular

                                of stake means that miners use their own coins as a pledge to verify any transactions
