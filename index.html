        <p id="impactTextID">Cryptocurrencies are
            seen
            as a great way to possibly get rich quick, with rumors of people amassing millions of dollars from
            mining
            for various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. However, there is a large downside to crypto mining that
            can
            not be ignored. Mining for crypto is a very power intensive process and with cryptocurrencies on the
            rise,
            more and more people are building mining farms that are drawing in insane amounts of power. Crypto
            mining
            involves using incredibly powerful computers containing top of the line GPUs to solve the complex
            mathematical hash algorithms that are required for unlocking (mining) the next block of crypto coins.
            The
            first person to solve the algorithm is rewarded with a black reward that corresponds to an amount of
            bitcoin. Due to this process rewarding the first person, people are spending more money to build bigger
            farms, which draw more power, in order to have a higher chance of being first.</p>
