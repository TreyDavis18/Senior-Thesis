                        <p>Cryptocurrencies are a form of decentralized digital currency, meaning that the currency is
                            not stored by any bank or company. Normal currencies are tracked and regulated by banks who
                            will verify transactions to keep an eye on what is going on with the currencies that they
                            regulate. Cryptocurrencies however, use a process of “trustless verification” to verify
                            transactions, meaning that there is no central agency who has the ledger of transactions.
                            The “ledgers”, also referred to as blockchain, for different cryptocurrencies are kept by
                            everyone who takes part in mining each particular cryptocurrency. (3Blue1Brown, 2017) This
                            website will focus on the incredibly popular cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.</p>
