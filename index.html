                <h2>How much energy is used to mine a bitcoin?</h2>

                <p>Mining for Bitcoin is not an energy efficient process. As of August 2021, it uses around the same
                    amount
                    of energy that a typical household would use in 8 years. This is a little bit better than it was,
                    hitting a max energy consumption of the average household over 13 years in early 2021, but this is
                    still
                    not a sustainable amount of energy for Bitcoin. <a

                <h2>How much energy is used on a Bitcoin transaction?</h2>

                <p>A report from 2021 stated that every Bitcoin transaction uses over 1,000 kilowatt hours of
                    electricity. <a

                    Even
                    using Bitcoin just to buy a sandwich, uses more energy than an average household uses in six weeks,
                    or enough energy to drive an average electric car for over 3,300 miles (That's enough to drive
                    from coast to coast in the United States). 1,000 kWh is equal to over $100
                    worth of energy
                    for
                    every single transaction.</p>

                    consumptions?</h2>

                <h2>Environmentally conscious option for Bitcoin</h2>

                <p>Bitcoin uses code that is called “proof of work”. This necessitates a large amount of
                    computers in order to verify and secure the transactions that take place using
                    Bitcoin.
                    One
                    very possible option for Bitcoin is to follow in the path of another highly popular
                    cryptocurrency called Ethereum. Ethereum uses a code process called “proof of
                    stake”.
                    Proof
                    of stake means that miners use their own coins as a pledge, with this pledge they are given a chance
                    to verify transactions
                    that
                    use Ethereum, becoming a validator. This means that not everyone is allowed to mine for Ethereum,
                    only those who have put in the stake to earn a spot as a validator. A group made up of Greenpeace
                    USA, Environmental
                    Working
                    Group,
                    and other groups fighting against the environmental effects of cryptomining have
                    stated
                    that
                    changing Bitcoin from proof of work to proof of stake could reduce the energy
                    consumption of
                    Bitcoin by nearly 99%. <a
